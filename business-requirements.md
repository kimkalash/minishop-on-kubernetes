# Business Requirements

## 1. Business Purpose

Project Name: Minishop  
Goal:  
To build a modular, microservices-based e-commerce platform that demonstrates how secure, scalable, and automated cloud applications are designed and deployed.

Intent:  
Minishop serves as both a learning lab and a reference architecture for building distributed systems.  
It simulates a real online store where users can browse products, manage carts, place orders, process payments, and receive notifications through independent, containerized services.

Value:
- Demonstrates practical cloud-native architecture and DevOps practices.  
- Can be used as a learning or demonstration platform for engineering and security reviews.  
- Enables future expansion into SaaS or penetration-testing-oriented solutions.
