üèó Minishop System Design Document
1. High-Level Architecture

Microservices (FastAPI):

Auth

Catalog

Cart

Orders

Payments

Shipping

Notifications

Gateway

Databases:

PostgreSQL for Auth, Catalog, Orders, Shipping.

Redis for Cart.

External API for Payments.

SMTP/email API for Notifications.

Infrastructure:

Kubernetes cluster.

Helm charts for deployment.

ArgoCD for GitOps automation.

Communication: REST APIs across services.

Security: JWT tokens validated at Gateway.

(Insert High-Level Architecture Diagram here ‚Äî already generated in your playbook.)

2. Service-Level Design
2.1 Auth Service

Database: PostgreSQL.

Entities: User(id, username, email, hashed_password, email_verified).

Endpoints: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/me.

2.2 Catalog Service

Database: PostgreSQL.

Entities: Product(id, name, description, price, stock).

Endpoints: /catalog/products, /catalog/products/{id}.

2.3 Cart Service

Database: Redis.

Entities: Cart(user_id, items: [product_id, quantity]).

Endpoints: /cart/items, /cart, /cart/items/{id}.

2.4 Orders Service

Database: PostgreSQL.

Entities: Order(id, user_id, total_price, status).

Endpoints: /orders, /orders/{id}.

2.5 Payments Service

Integration: External API (mock in MVP).

Entities: Payment(order_id, amount, status).

Endpoints: /payments, /payments/{id}.

2.6 Shipping Service

Database: PostgreSQL.

Entities: Shipment(order_id, status, tracking_number).

Endpoints: /shipping, /shipping/{id}.

2.7 Notifications Service

Integration: SMTP/email API.

Events: OrderPlaced, PaymentConfirmed, Shipped.

Endpoints: /notify.

2.8 Gateway Service

Acts as API entry point.

Routes: /auth/*, /catalog/*, /cart/*, /orders/*, etc.

3. Data Model Design

ER Diagram linking User ‚Üí Order ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Shipping.

Separate DB per service (no shared DB).

Redis used as a key-value store for Cart.

(Insert ER Diagram here ‚Äî you can reuse from playbook visuals or draw new with dbdiagram.io / Mermaid.)

4. Sequence Diagrams
4.1 Checkout Flow

User logs in (Auth).

User adds product to Cart.

User creates Order from Cart.

Order triggers Payment request.

On success, Shipping record is created.

Notification is sent.

4.2 User Registration Flow

User registers (Auth DB updated).

JWT issued.

Gateway passes token for secure calls.

(Insert Sequence Diagram here ‚Äî can use Mermaid or PlantUML.)

5. API Contracts

Auth:

POST /auth/register ‚Üí UserResponse

POST /auth/login ‚Üí AccessToken

GET /auth/me ‚Üí UserResponse

Catalog:

POST /catalog/products ‚Üí ProductResponse

GET /catalog/products ‚Üí [ProductResponse]

GET /catalog/products/{id} ‚Üí ProductResponse

Cart:

POST /cart/items ‚Üí MessageResponse

GET /cart ‚Üí CartResponse

DELETE /cart/items/{id} ‚Üí MessageResponse

DELETE /cart ‚Üí MessageResponse

Orders:

POST /orders ‚Üí OrderResponse

GET /orders/{id} ‚Üí OrderResponse

Payments:

POST /payments ‚Üí PaymentResponse

Shipping:

POST /shipping ‚Üí ShipmentResponse

Notifications:

POST /notify ‚Üí MessageResponse

6. Infrastructure Design

Deployment: Kubernetes + Helm + ArgoCD.

Config: Kubernetes Secrets (JWT secret, DB URLs).

Observability: Prometheus/Grafana + OpenTelemetry.

Scalability: HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler).
